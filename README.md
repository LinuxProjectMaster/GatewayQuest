# GatewayQuest
Submission for Stellar Gateway Quest Devpost Hackathon

This project was inspired Torres et al., “A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting SEP Proton Intensity and Events Using Time Series of Relativistic Electron Measurements.”
Data was taken from https://zenodo.org/records/12832882 and https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/goes/
Features a darts N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analyis for Interpretable Time Series) model for prediction
React-Bootstrap frontend with Recharts.js
Flask Backend: Darts, Numpy, Pandas
