##### This project was inspired Torres et al., “A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting SEP Proton Intensity and Events Using Time Series of Relativistic Electron Measurements.”
##### Data was taken from https://zenodo.org/records/12832882 and https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/goes/
##### Features a darts N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analyis for Interpretable Time Series) model for prediction
*React-Bootstrap* frontend with Recharts.js
*Flask Backend:* Darts, Numpy, Pandas
